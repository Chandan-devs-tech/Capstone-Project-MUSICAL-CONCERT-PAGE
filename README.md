<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

- New Developer Usage: To get a local copy up and running, follow these steps:

  - Clone the repository to your local machine.
  - Open the project directory in a code editor.
  - Open the index.html file in a web browser to view the website.
  - Make changes to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files to modify the website as needed.

### Prerequisites

- A web browser: You will need a modern web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari to view and test your project.
- A code editor: You will need a code editor such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Atom to write, edit, and manage your project's files.
- A local server: You will need a local server such as XAMPP or WAMP to run your project locally and test it on your own computer.
- Knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript: You will need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in order to build a web development project.
- Familiarity with Git and GitHub: If you are using Git and GitHub to manage your project's codebase, you will need to be familiar with how to use them.

### Setup

- Open a command-line interface (e.g. Terminal on Mac or Linux, Command Prompt on Windows).
- Navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository using the cd command.
- Use the git clone command followed by the repository's URL to clone the repository. For example:
  git clone https://github.com/Chandan-devs-tech/Capstone-project.git
- Press enter and wait for the repository to finish cloning.

### Install

- Clone the repository to your local machine using the git clone command as described in the previous answer.
- Navigate to the project folder using a command-line interface such as Terminal or Command Prompt.
- Install any necessary dependencies using a package manager such as NPM or Yarn. You can do this by running the npm install or yarn install command in the project folder.
- Start the local server using a command such as npm start or yarn start, depending on the project's setup.
- Open a web browser and navigate to the local server's URL to view and test the project.

### Usage

- Assuming that you have installed the project's dependencies and started the local server, you can run the project by following these steps:

  - Open a web browser such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, or Safari.
  - In the address bar, type the URL of the local server that you started in the previous step. This will typically be something like http://localhost:3000.
  - Press enter to navigate to the local server's URL.
  - The project should now be running in your web browser. Use the website's interface to interact with the project and test its functionality.

### Run tests

- To run tests for a web development project, follow these steps:

  - Open a command-line interface such as Terminal or Command Prompt.
  - Navigate to the project folder using the cd command.
  - Run the appropriate testing command for your project. This may vary depending on the project's testing framework and setup. For example, you may need to run a command like npm test or yarn test, or you may need to run tests for specific files or modules using a command like pytest path/to/test_file.py.
  - Wait for the tests to finish running. Depending on the size and complexity of your project, this may take several minutes.
  - Check the output of the tests to see if there are any failures or errors. If there are, you may need to modify your code to fix the issues and re-run the tests.

### Deployment

- Project is deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ (OPTIONAL) <a name="faq"></a>

[Question_1]

- How can I customize the visual design of the Rock music concert project to fit my specific needs?

  - [Answer_1]

    - The visual design of the Rock music concert project can be customized by modifying the CSS code. The project utilizes a combination of flexbox, grid, and media queries to create a responsive layout, and semantic HTML tags to provide structure and accessibility. By tweaking the values of CSS properties such as colors, fonts, and layout rules, you can adjust the look and feel of the project to match your preferences. Additionally, you can add or remove content within the HTML and JavaScript files to tailor the project to your specific use case.

[Question_2]

- How can I add new functionality to the Rock music concert project, such as a feature to purchase tickets?

  - [Answer_2]

    - The Rock music concert project is built using JavaScript, which allows for a wide range of custom functionality to be added. To add a feature such as ticket purchasing, you can start by modifying the JavaScript code to create a new function or class that handles the logic of the feature. You may also need to modify the HTML and CSS to add new UI elements and styles that support the new feature. Additionally, you may want to consider integrating third-party libraries or APIs that provide additional functionality, such as payment processing or event scheduling.
